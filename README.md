# Inventory App
A NFT Inventory app loosely based on an OpenSea layout - allows users to perform all CRUD operations to mimic a NFT marketplace. Created with Node.js/Express.

This project provided a chance to create my first fully fledged CRUD backend application. The design uses simple EJS layouts as the focus was on implementing CRUD operations. Image upload is supported with Multer.
